## Description
This game has been developed in ```three.js``` as final project of the exam Interactive Graphics.

You play as a knight, tasked with defeating a powerful monster. In your normal state, you're too weak to win. However, by collecting swords, you can boost your strength. Gather 5 stars to temporarily transform into a larger, more powerful knight, but the transformation lasts only 15 seconds. You can also collect hearts to restore your health.
